    <h3>description</h3>
    <p>A burger is a beloved sandwich consisting of a ground meat patty, typically beef, served inside a sliced bun. The patty can be grilled, fried, or broiled, and is often seasoned to enhance its rich flavor. Burgers are customizable and can be topped with a variety of ingredients, including lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, cheese, and condiments like ketchup, mustard, or mayonnaise. Variations abound, with options for chicken, turkey, fish, or plant-based patties catering to diverse dietary preferences. Burgers are a popular choice for casual dining, barbecues, and fast food, celebrated for their satisfying taste and versatility in flavors and textures.</p>
    <h3>ingredient</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>5 fresh jalapeno peppers
            <li>4 pounds ground beef
            <li>salt and pepper to taste
            <li>1 egg
            <li>¼ cup steak sauce, (e.g. Heinz 57)
            <li>cup minced white onion
            <li>1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce (e.g. Tabasco™)
            <li>1 pinch dried oregano
            <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic salt
            <li>¼ cup crushed Fritos® corn chips
            <li>8 large potato hamburger buns
            <li>8 slices pepperjack cheese
        </ul>
    <h3>steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat a grill for high heat. When the grill is hot, roast the jalapeno peppers until blackened on all sides. Place in a plastic bag to sweat and loosen the blackened skin. Rub the skin off, then seed if desired, and chop.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, use your hands to mix together the chopped jalapenos, ground beef, salt, pepper, egg, steak sauce, onion, hot pepper sauce, oregano, Worcestershire sauce, garlic salt and Fritos®. Divide into 8 balls, and flatten into patties.</li>
            <li>Grill patties for 10 to 15 minutes, turning once, or until well done. I always drink one beer, then flip, drink another beer, then remove from the grill and place on buns. Top each one with a slice of pepperjack cheese and pig out!</li>
        </ol>
